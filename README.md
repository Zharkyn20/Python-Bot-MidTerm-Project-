# Python Bot (MidTerm Project)
I created Blood Type Bot for 3 important reasons:
   - The importance of knowing your blood type is to prevent the risk of you receiving an incompatible blood type at a time of need, such as during a blood transfusion or during surgery.
   - Knowing your Rh blood type is also important for pregnant women. If a women is Rh-negative and pregnant with a baby who is Rh-positive, it can lead to a condition known as Rh-incompatibility.
   - One of the most valuable reasons to know about your blood type is to help others as a donor.
